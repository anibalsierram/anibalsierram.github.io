								<h1>Spiral Arms and a Massive Dust Disk with Non-Keplerian Kinematics: Possible Evidence for Gravitational Instability in the Disk of Elias 2–27</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Paneque-Carreno et al. 2021</h3>
								<p>Abstract: To determine the origin of the spiral structure observed in the dust continuum emission of Elias 2–27 we analyze 
									multiwavelength continuum ALMA data with a resolution of ~0.2 arcsec (~23 au) at 0.89, 1.3, and 3.3 mm. We also study the 
									kinematics of the disk with 13CO and C18O ALMA observations in the J = 3–2 transition. The spiral arm morphology is 
									recovered at all wavelengths in the dust continuum observations, where we measure contrast and spectral index variations 
									along the spiral arms and detect subtle dust-trapping signatures. We determine that the emission from the midplane is cold
									and interpret the optical depth results as signatures of a disk mass higher than previous constraints. From the gas data,
									we search for deviations from Keplerian motion and trace the morphology of the emitting surfaces and the velocity profiles.
									We find an azimuthally varying emission layer height in the system, large-scale emission surrounding the disk, and strong
									perturbations in the channel maps, colocated with the spirals. Additionally, we develop multigrain dust and gas hydrodynamical
									simulations of a gravitationally unstable disk and compare them to the observations. Given the large-scale emission and
									highly perturbed gas structure, together with the comparison of continuum observations to theoretical predictions, we propose
									infall-triggered gravitational instabilities as the origin for the observed spiral structure..</p>

								<h1>Impact of Differential Dust Settling on the SED and Polarization: Application to the Inner Region of the HL Tau Disk</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Ueda et al. 2021</h3>
								<p>Abstract: The polarimetric observations of the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau have shown the scattering-induced polarization
								at ALMA Band 7, which indicates that the maximum dust size is ~100 μm, while the spectral energy distribution (SED) has suggested 
								that the maximum dust size is approximately a millimeter. To solve the contradiction, we investigate the impact of differential 
								settling of dust grains on the SED and polarization. If the disk is optically thick, a longer observing wavelength traces more interior
								layers, which would be dominated by larger grains. We find that the SED of the center part of the HL Tau disk can be explained with
								millimeter-sized grains for a broad range of turbulence strength, while 160 μm–sized grains cannot be explained unless the turbulence
								strength parameter αt is lower than 10−5. We also find that the observed polarization fraction can be potentially explained with a
								maximum dust size of 1 mm if αt lesssim 10−5, although models with 160 μm–sized grains are also acceptable. However, if the maximum 
								dust size is ~3 mm, the simulated polarization fraction is too low to explain the observations even if the turbulence strength is
								extremely small, indicating a maximum dust size of lesssim1 mm. The degeneracy between 100 μm– and millimeter-sized grains can be
								solved by improving the ALMA calibration accuracy or polarimetric observations at (sub)centimeter wavelengths.</p>

								<h1>Effects of Scattering, Temperature Gradients, and Settling on the Derived Dust Properties of Observed Protoplanetary Disks</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Sierra & Lizano 2020</h3>
								<p>Abstract: It is known that the millimeter dust thermal emission of protoplanetary disks is affected by scattering, such that for
								optically thick disks, the emission decreases with respect to the pure absorption case and the spectral indices can
								reach values below 2. The latter can also be obtained with temperature gradients. Using simple analytical models of
								radiative transfer in thin slabs, we quantify the effect of scattering, vertical temperature gradients, and dust settling
								on the emission and spectral indices of geometrically thin face-on accretion disks around young stars. We find that,
								in vertically isothermal disks with large albedo (> 0.6), the emergent intensity can increase at optical depths
								between 10^−2 and 10^−1.
								We show that dust settling has important effects on the spectral indices in the optically
								thick regime, since the disk emission mainly traces small dust grains in the upper layers of the disk. The
								λ = 870 μm emission of these small grains can hide large grains at the disk midplane when the dust surface
								density is larger than ∼3.21 g cm^−2. 
								Finally, because of the change of the shape of the spectral energy distribution,
								optically thick disks at 1.3 mm and grains with sizes between 300 m 1 m < < amax mm have a 7 mm flux ∼60%
								higher than the extrapolation from higher millimeter frequencies, assumed when scattering is neglected. This effect
								could provide an explanation for the excess emission at l = 7 mm reported in several disks.</p>

								<h1>Exploring the Grain Properties in the Disk of HL Tau with an Evolutionary Model</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Tapia et al. 2019</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We model the ALMA and Very Large Array (VLA) millimeter radial profiles of the disk around HL Tau to
								constrain the properties of the dust grains. We adopt the disk evolutionary models of Lynden-Bell & Pringle
								and calculate their temperature and density structure and emission. These disks are heated by the internal viscosity
								and irradiated by the central star and a warm envelope. We consider a dust size distribution n(a)da ∝ a^−3.5 da, and
								vary the maximum grain size in the atmosphere and the midplane, amax = 100 μm, 1 mm, and 1 cm. We also
								include dust settling and vary the dust-to-gas mass ratio from 1 to 9 times the ISM value. We find that the models
								that can fit the observed level of emission along the profiles at all wavelengths have an atmosphere with a
								maximum grain size amax = 100 μm, and a midplane with amax = 1 cm. The disk substructure, with a deficit of
								emission in the gaps, can be due to dust properties in these regions that are different from those in the rings. We test
								an opacity effect (different amax) and a dust mass deficit (smaller dust-to-gas mass ratio) in the gaps. We find that
								the emission profiles are better reproduced by models with a dust deficit in the gaps, although a combined effect is
								also possible. These models have a global dust-to-gas mass ratio twice the ISM value, needed to reach the level of
								emission of the 7.8 mm VLA profile.</p>

								<h1>The Radial Distribution of Dust Particles in the HL Tau Disk from ALMA and VLA Observations</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Carrasco-Gonzalez et al. 2019</h3>
								<p>Abstract: Understanding planet formation requires one to discern how dust grows in protoplanetary disks. An important
								parameter to measure in disks is the maximum dust grain size present. This is usually estimated through
								measurements of the dust opacity at different millimeter wavelengths assuming optically thin emission and dust
								opacity dominated by absorption. However, Atacama Large Millimeter /submillimeter Array (ALMA)
								observations have shown that these assumptions might not be correct in the case of protoplanetary disks,
								leading to overestimation of particle sizes and to underestimation of the disk’s mass. Here, we present an analysis
								of high-quality ALMA and Very Large Array images of the HL Tau protoplanetary disk, covering a wide range of
								wavelengths, from 0.8 mm to 1 cm, and with a physical resolution of ∼7.35 au. We describe a procedure to analyze
								a set of millimeter images without any assumption about the optical depth of the emission, and including the effects
								of absorption and scattering in the dust opacity. This procedure allows us to obtain the dust temperature, the dust
								surface density, and the maximum particle size at each radius. In the HL Tau disk, we found that particles have
								already grown to a few millimeters in size. We detect differences in the dust properties between dark and bright
								rings, with dark rings containing low dust density and small dust particles. Different features in the HL Tau disk
								seem to have different origins. Planet–disk interactions can explain substructure in the external half of the disk, but
								the internal rings seem to be associated with the presence of snow lines of several molecules.</p>

								<h1>An Analytical Model of Radial Dust Trapping in Protoplanetary Disks</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Sierra et al. 2019</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We study dust concentration in axisymmetric gas rings in protoplanetary disks. Given the gas surface density, we
								derived an analytical total dust surface density by taking into account the differential concentration of all grain
								sizes. This model allows us to predict the local dust-to-gas mass ratio and the slope of the particle size distribution,
								as a function of radius. We test this analytical model by comparing it with a 3D magnetohydrodynamical
								simulation of dust evolution in an accretion disk. The model is also applied to the disk around HD 169142. By
								fitting the disk continuum observations simultaneously at λ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.0 mm, we obtain a global dust-togas mass ratio of 1.05 ×10^2 and a viscosity coefficient α = 1.35 × 10^−2.
								This model can be easily implemented in numerical simulations of accretion disks..</p>

								<h1>Cm-wavelength observations of MWC 758: resolved dust trapping in a vortex</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Casassus et al. 2019</h3>
								<p>Abstract: The large crescents imaged by ALMA in transition discs suggest that azimuthal dust trapping
								concentrates the larger grains, but centimetre–wavelengths continuum observations are required to map the distribution of the largest observable grains. A previous detection at ∼1 cm
								of an unresolved clump along the outer ring of MWC 758 (Clump 1), and buried inside more
								extended sub-mm continuum, motivates followup VLA observations. Deep multiconfiguration
								integrations reveal the morphology of Clump 1 and additional cm-wave components that we
								characterize via comparison with a deconvolution of recent 342 GHz data (∼1 mm). Clump 1,
								which concentrates ∼1/3 of the whole disc flux density at ∼1 cm, is resolved as a narrow arc
								with a deprojected aspect ratio χ > 5.6, and with half the azimuthal width than at 342 GHz.
								The spectral trends in the morphology of Clump 1 are quantitatively consistent with the LyraLin prescriptions for dust trapping in an anticyclonic vortex, provided with porous grains
								(f ∼ 0.2 ± 0.2) in a very elongated (χ ∼ 14 ± 3) and cold (T ∼ 23 ± 2 K) vortex. The same
								prescriptions constrain the turbulence parameter α and the gas surface density g through
								log10(α × Sigma/g cm−2) ∼ −2.3 ± 0.4, thus requiring values for Sigma larger than a factor of a
								few compared to that reported in the literature from the CO isotopologues, if α < 10−3. Such
								physical conditions imply an appreciably optically thick continuum even at cm-wavelengths
								(τ33 GHz ∼ 0.2). A secondary and shallower peak at 342 GHz is about twice fainter relative to
								Clump 1 at 33 GHz. Clump 2 appears to be less efficient at trapping large grains.</p>

								<h1>Dust Concentration and Emission in Protoplanetary Disks Vortices</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Sierra et al. 2017</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We study the dust concentration and emission in protoplanetary disks vortices. We extend the Lyra-Lin solution for
								the dust concentration of a single grain size to a power-law distribution of grain sizes. Assuming dust
								conservation in the disk, we find an analytic dust surface density as a function of the grain radius. We calculate the
								increase of the dust-to-gas mass ratio and the slope of the dust size distribution due to grain segregation within
								the vortex. We apply this model to a numerical simulation of a disk containing a persistent vortex. Due to the
								accumulation of large grains toward the vortex center, the dust-to-gas mass ratio increases by a factor of 10 from the background disk value,
								and decreases from 3.5 to 3.0. We find the disk emission at millimeter wavelengths corresponding to synthetic
								observations with ALMA and VLA. The simulated maps at 7 mm and 1 cm show a strong azimuthal asymmetry.
								This happens because, at these wavelengths, the disk becomes optically thin while the vortex remains optically
								thick. The large vortex opacity is mainly due to an increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio. In addition, the change in
								the slope of the dust size distribution increases the opacity by a factor of two. We also show that the inclusion of
								the dust scattering opacity substantially changes the disks images.</p>

								<h1>Imaging a Central Ionized Component, a Narrow Ring, and the CO Snowline in the Multigapped Disk of HD 169142</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Macias et al. 2017</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We report Very Large Array observations at 7 mm, 9 mm, and 3 cm toward the pre-transitional disk of the Herbig
								Ae star HD 169142. These observations have allowed us to study the millimeter emission of this disk with the
								highest angular resolution so far (0 12 × 0 09, or 14 au × 11 au, at 7 mm). Our 7 and 9 mm images show a
								narrow ring of emission at a radius of ∼25 au tracing the outer edge of the inner gap. This ring presents an
								asymmetric morphology that could be produced by dynamical interactions between the disk and forming planets.
								Additionally, the azimuthally averaged radial intensity profiles of the 7 and 9 mm images confirm the presence of
								the previously reported gap at ∼45 au and reveal a new gap at ∼85 au. We analyzed archival DCO+(3–2) and
								C18O(2–1) ALMA observations, showing that the CO snowline is located very close to this third outer gap. This
								suggests that growth and accumulation of large dust grains close to the CO snowline could be the mechanism
								responsible for this proposed outer gap. Finally, a compact source of emission is detected at 7 mm, 9 mm, and 3 cm
								toward the center of the disk. Its flux density and spectral index indicate that it is dominated by free–free emission
								from ionized gas, which could be associated with the photoionization of the inner disk, an independent object, or
								an ionized jet.</p>
