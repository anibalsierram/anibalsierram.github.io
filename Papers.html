										<b>Abstract:</b> The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d ∼ 140-200 pc).
										We present the complete continuum size distribution for the 105 brightest protoplanetary disks (Mdust ≳ 2 M⊕) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA
										Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05′′ (7 au) to 0.15′′ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources,
										providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling 68% of the
										flux (R68%) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal
										with a median value of ∼14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation σlog=0.46 (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems (< 200 au separation)
										have smaller radii, with median value of ∼5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young
										embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age ≲ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age ∼ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be
										common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key 
										ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. 
										We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis
										on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm → 7.46 mm range)
										to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies
										and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured
										in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer
										than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However,
										lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth
										of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations
										in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution
										of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total
										dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses
										from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically
										thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one
										order of magnitude.<br/>

									<h3>Constraints on the physical origin of large cavities in transition disks from multi-wavelength dust continuum emission</h3>

										<b>Abstract:</b> The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms
										(e.g., a  companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution
										of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities
										of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau,
										and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength
										data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density,
										maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical
										mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A,
										LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S,
										DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, 
										we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large 
										Program "AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks". The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter 
										Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines:  12CO(J=2-1),  13CO(J=2-1), C18O(J=2-1), 
										and H2CO(J=3 (3,0)-2(2,0)). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like
										structure with a peak at  0.57′′(75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24′′(31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner 
										disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to  3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the
										disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure)
										through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of  ∼0.875′′ (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO
										velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that
										of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to
										signatures of planet formation.<br/>

									<h3>Dust-Trapping Ring in the Planet-Hosting Disk of Elias 2-24</h3>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring 
										pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following
										the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A
										dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting
										disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029
										arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently
										trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence (8 × 10−4 < αturb < 0.03) and the gas-to-dust ratio
										(Σg/Σd < 30) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust
										disk mass of Mdust = 13.8(+0.7,−0.5) × 10−4 M⊙. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber,
										the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10−3 of the peak flux in the disk.<br/>

									<h3>Porous Dust Particles in Protoplanetary Disks: Application to the HLTau Disk</h3>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Dust particle sizes constrained from dust continuum and polarization observations by radio interferometry are inconsistent
										by at least an order of magnitude. Motivated by porous dust observed in small Solar System bodies (e.g., from the Rosetta mission), we 
										explore how the dust particle's porosity affects the estimated particle sizes from these two methods. Porous particles have lower refractive 
										indices, which affect both opacity and polarization fraction. With weaker Mie interference patterns, the porous particles have lower opacity
										at mm wavelengths than the compact particles if the particle size exceeds several hundred microns. Consequently, the inferred dust mass using
										porous particles can be up to a factor of six higher. The most significant difference between compact and porous particles is their scattering
										properties. The porous particles have a wider range of particle sizes with high linear polarization from dust self-scattering, allowing mm-cm-sized
										particles to explain polarization observations. With a Bayesian approach, we use porous particles to fit HL Tau disk's multi-wavelength continuum
										and mm-polarization observations from ALMA and VLA. The moderately porous particles with sizes from 1 mm-1 m can explain both continuum and
										polarization observations, especially in the region between 20-60 au. If the particles in HL Tau are porous, the porosity should be from 70% to
										97% from current polarization observations. We also predict that future observations of the self-scattering linear polarization at longer
										wavelengths (e.g., ALMA B1 and ngVLA) have the potential to further constrain the particle's porosity and size.<br/>
