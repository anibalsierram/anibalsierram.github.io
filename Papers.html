								<h1>Dust Concentration and Emission in Protoplanetary Disks Vortices</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Sierra et al. 2017</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We study the dust concentration and emission in protoplanetary disks vortices. We extend the Lyra-Lin solution for
								the dust concentration of a single grain size to a power-law distribution of grain sizes n a a µ -p ( ) . Assuming dust
								conservation in the disk, we find an analytic dust surface density as a function of the grain radius. We calculate the
								increase of the dust-to-gas mass ratio ò and the slope p of the dust size distribution due to grain segregation within
								the vortex. We apply this model to a numerical simulation of a disk containing a persistent vortex. Due to the
								accumulation of large grains toward the vortex center, ò increases by a factor of 10 from the background disk value,
								and p decreases from 3.5 to 3.0. We find the disk emission at millimeter wavelengths corresponding to synthetic
								observations with ALMA and VLA. The simulated maps at 7 mm and 1 cm show a strong azimuthal asymmetry.
								This happens because, at these wavelengths, the disk becomes optically thin while the vortex remains optically
								thick. The large vortex opacity is mainly due to an increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio. In addition, the change in
								the slope of the dust size distribution increases the opacity by a factor of two. We also show that the inclusion of
								the dust scattering opacity substantially changes the disks images.</p>

								<h1>Imaging a Central Ionized Component, a Narrow Ring, and the CO Snowline in the Multigapped Disk of HD 169142</h1>
								<h3 style="color:White;">Macias et al. 2017</h3>
								<p>Abstract: We report Very Large Array observations at 7 mm, 9 mm, and 3 cm toward the pre-transitional disk of the Herbig
								Ae star HD 169142. These observations have allowed us to study the millimeter emission of this disk with the
								highest angular resolution so far (0 12 × 0 09, or 14 au × 11 au, at 7 mm). Our 7 and 9 mm images show a
								narrow ring of emission at a radius of ∼25 au tracing the outer edge of the inner gap. This ring presents an
								asymmetric morphology that could be produced by dynamical interactions between the disk and forming planets.
								Additionally, the azimuthally averaged radial intensity profiles of the 7 and 9 mm images confirm the presence of
								the previously reported gap at ∼45 au and reveal a new gap at ∼85 au. We analyzed archival DCO+(3–2) and
								C18O(2–1) ALMA observations, showing that the CO snowline is located very close to this third outer gap. This
								suggests that growth and accumulation of large dust grains close to the CO snowline could be the mechanism
								responsible for this proposed outer gap. Finally, a compact source of emission is detected at 7 mm, 9 mm, and 3 cm
								toward the center of the disk. Its flux density and spectral index indicate that it is dominated by free–free emission
								from ionized gas, which could be associated with the photoionization of the inner disk, an independent object, or
								an ionized jet.</p>
