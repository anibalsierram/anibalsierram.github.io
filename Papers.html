										<b>Abstract:</b> The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d ∼ 140-200 pc).
										We present the complete continuum size distribution for the 105 brightest protoplanetary disks (Mdust ≳ 2 M⊕) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA
										Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05′′ (7 au) to 0.15′′ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources,
										providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling 68% of the
										flux (R68%) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal
										with a median value of ∼14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation σlog=0.46 (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems (< 200 au separation)
										have smaller radii, with median value of ∼5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young
										embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age ≲ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age ∼ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be
										common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key 
										ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. 
										We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis
										on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm → 7.46 mm range)
										to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies
										and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured
										in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer
										than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However,
										lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth
										of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations
										in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution
										of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total
										dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses
										from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically
										thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one
										order of magnitude.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms
										(e.g., a  companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution
										of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multi-wavelength interferometric visibilities
										of dust continuum observations obtained with ALMA and VLA for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau,
										and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multi-wavelength
										data is used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density,
										maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical
										mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A,
										LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S,
										DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, 
										we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large 
										Program "AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks". The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter 
										Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines:  12CO(J=2-1),  13CO(J=2-1), C18O(J=2-1), 
										and H2CO(J=3 (3,0)-2(2,0)). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like
										structure with a peak at  0.57′′(75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24′′(31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner 
										disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to  3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the
										disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure)
										through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of  ∼0.875′′ (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO
										velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that
										of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to
										signatures of planet formation.<br/>

									<h3>Dust-Trapping Ring in the Planet-Hosting Disk of Elias 2-24</h3>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring 
										pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following
										the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A
										dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting
										disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029
										arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently
										trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence (8 × 10−4 < αturb < 0.03) and the gas-to-dust ratio
										(Σg/Σd < 30) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust
										disk mass of Mdust = 13.8(+0.7,−0.5) × 10−4 M⊙. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber,
										the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10−3 of the peak flux in the disk.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Dust particle sizes constrained from dust continuum and polarization observations by radio interferometry are inconsistent
										by at least an order of magnitude. Motivated by porous dust observed in small Solar System bodies (e.g., from the Rosetta mission), we 
										explore how the dust particle's porosity affects the estimated particle sizes from these two methods. Porous particles have lower refractive 
										indices, which affect both opacity and polarization fraction. With weaker Mie interference patterns, the porous particles have lower opacity
										at mm wavelengths than the compact particles if the particle size exceeds several hundred microns. Consequently, the inferred dust mass using
										porous particles can be up to a factor of six higher. The most significant difference between compact and porous particles is their scattering
										properties. The porous particles have a wider range of particle sizes with high linear polarization from dust self-scattering, allowing mm-cm-sized
										particles to explain polarization observations. With a Bayesian approach, we use porous particles to fit HL Tau disk's multi-wavelength continuum
										and mm-polarization observations from ALMA and VLA. The moderately porous particles with sizes from 1 mm-1 m can explain both continuum and
										polarization observations, especially in the region between 20-60 au. If the particles in HL Tau are porous, the porosity should be from 70% to
										97% from current polarization observations. We also predict that future observations of the self-scattering linear polarization at longer
										wavelengths (e.g., ALMA B1 and ngVLA) have the potential to further constrain the particle's porosity and size.<br/>

									<h3>MAPS: A Circumplanetary Disk Candidate in Molecular-line Emission in the AS 209 Disk</h3>

										<b>Abstract:</b> We report the discovery of a circumplanetary disk (CPD) candidate embedded in the circumstellar disk of the T Tauri
										star AS 209 at a radial distance of about 200 au (on-sky separation of 1farcs4 from the star at a position angle of 161°), isolated
										via 13CO J = 2−1 emission. This is the first instance of CPD detection via gaseous emission capable of tracing the overall CPD mass.
										The CPD is spatially unresolved with a 117 × 82 mas beam and manifests as a point source in 13CO, indicating that its diameter
										is ≲14 au. The CPD is embedded within an annular gap in the circumstellar disk previously identified using 12CO and near-infrared 
										scattered-light observations and is associated with localized velocity perturbations in 12CO. The coincidence of these features 
										suggests that they have a common origin: an embedded giant planet. We use the 13CO intensity to constrain the CPD gas temperature 
										and mass. We find that the CPD temperature is ≳35 K, higher than the circumstellar disk temperature at the radial location of the 
										CPD, 22 K, suggesting that heating sources localized to the CPD must be present. The CPD gas mass is ≳0.095 MJup ≃ 30 M⊕ adopting 
										a standard 13CO abundance. From the nondetection of millimeter continuum emission at the location of the CPD (3σ flux density ≲26.4 μJy),
										we infer that the CPD dust mass is ≲0.027 M⊕ ≃ 2.2 lunar masses, indicating a low dust-to-gas mass ratio of ≲9 × 10−4. We discuss
										the formation mechanism of the CPD-hosting giant planet on a wide orbit in the framework of gravitational instability and pebble
										accretion.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> High dust density in the midplane of protoplanetary disks is favorable for efficient grain growth and can allow fast
										formation of planetesimals and planets, before disks dissipate. Vertical settling and dust trapping in pressure
										maxima are two mechanisms allowing dust to concentrate in geometrically thin and high-density regions. In this
										work, we aim to study these mechanisms in the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTC2D J163131.2-242627
										(Oph 163131, i ∼ 84°). We present new high-angular-resolution continuum and 12CO ALMA observations of
										Oph 163131. The gas emission appears significantly more extended in the vertical and radial direction compared to
										the dust emission, consistent with vertical settling and possibly radial drift. In addition, the new continuum
										observations reveal two clear rings. The outer ring, located at ∼100 au, is well-resolved in the observations,
										allowing us to put stringent constraints on the vertical extent of millimeter dust particles. We model the disk using
										radiative transfer and find that the scale height of millimeter-sized grains is 0.5 au or less at 100 au from the central
										star. This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the scale height of smaller micron-sized dust grains
										constrained by previous modeling, which implies that efficient settling of the large grains is occurring in the disk.
										When adopting a parametric dust settling prescription, we find that the observations are consistent with a turbulent
										viscosity coefficient of about α ~ 10−5 at 100 au. Finally, we find that the thin dust scale height measured in
										Oph 163131 is favorable for planetary growth by pebble accretion: a 10 ME planet may grow within less than
										10 Myr, even in orbits exceeding 50 au.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Constraining dust properties of planet-forming disks via high angular resolution observations is
										fundamental to understanding how solids are trapped in substructures and how dust growth may be
										favored or accelerated therein. We use ALMA dust continuum observations of the Molecules with
										ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) disks and explore a large parameter space to constrain the
										radial distribution of solid mass and maximum grain size in each disk, including or excluding dust
										scattering. In the nonscattering model, the dust surface density and maximum grain size profiles
										decrease from the inner disks to the outer disks, with local maxima at the bright ring locations,
										as expected from dust trapping models. The inferred maximum grain sizes from the inner to outer
										disks decrease from 1 cm to 1 mm. For IM Lup, HD 163296, and MWC 480 in the scattering model,
										two solutions are compatible with their observed inner disk emission: one solution corresponding
										to a maximum grain size of a few millimeters (similar to the nonscattering model), and the other
										corresponding to a few hundred micrometer sizes. Based on the estimated Toomre parameter, only IM
										Lup – which shows a prominent spiral morphology in millimeter dust – is found to be gravitationally
										unstable. The estimated maximum Stokes number in all the disks lies between 0.01 and 0.3, and the
										estimated turbulence parameters in the rings of AS 209 and HD 163296 are close to the threshold where
										dust growth is limited by turbulent fragmentation. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of
										the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust and gas-rich disks around young stars, and the
										outcome of this process is intimately linked to the disk chemical properties. The distributions of
										molecules across disks regulate the elemental compositions of planets, including C/N/O/S ratios and
										metallicity (O/H and C/H), as well as access to water and prebiotically relevant organics. Emission
										from molecules also encodes information on disk ionization levels, temperature structures, kinematics,
										and gas surface densities, which are all key ingredients of disk evolution and planet formation models.
										The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program was designed to
										expand our understanding of the chemistry of planet formation by exploring disk chemical structures
										down to 10 au scales. The MAPS program focuses on five disks – around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209,
										HD 163296, and MWC 480 – in which dust substructures are detected and planet formation appears to
										be ongoing. We observed these disks in 4 spectral setups, which together cover ∼50 lines from over 20
										different species. This paper introduces the ApJS MAPS Special Issue by presenting an overview of the
										program motivation, disk sample, observational details, and calibration strategy. We also highlight key
										results, including discoveries of links between dust, gas, and chemical sub-structures, large reservoirs
										of nitriles and other organics in the inner disk regions, and elevated C/O ratios across most disks. We
										discuss how this collection of results is reshaping our view of the chemistry of planet formation.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program provides a detailed,
										high resolution (∼10–20 au) view of molecular line emission in five protoplanetary disks at spatial
										scales relevant for planet formation. Here, we present a systematic analysis of chemical substructures
										in 18 molecular lines toward the MAPS sources: IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480.
										We identify more than 200 chemical substructures, which are found at nearly all radii where line
										emission is detected. A wide diversity of radial morphologies — including rings, gaps, and plateaus —
										is observed both within each disk and across the MAPS sample. This diversity in line emission profiles
										is also present in the innermost 50 au. Overall, this suggests that planets form in varied chemical
										environments both across disks and at different radii within the same disk. Interior to 150 au, the
										majority of chemical substructures across the MAPS disks are spatially coincident with substructures
										in the millimeter continuum, indicative of physical and chemical links between the disk midplane and
										warm, elevated molecular emission layers. Some chemical substructures in the inner disk and most
										chemical substructures exterior to 150 au cannot be directly linked to dust substructure, however,
										which indicates that there are also other causes of chemical substructures, such as snowlines, gradients
										in UV photon fluxes, ionization, and radially-varying elemental ratios. This implies that chemical
										substructures could be developed into powerful probes of different disk characteristics, in addition to
										influencing the environments within which planets assemble. This paper is part of the MAPS special

										<b>Abstract:</b> Here we present high resolution (15-24 au) observations of CO isotopologue lines from the Molecules
										with ALMA on Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program. Our analysis employs 13CO and
										C18O (J=2-1), (1-0), and C17O (1-0) line observations of five protoplanetary disks. We retrieve CO gas
										density distributions, using three independent methods: (1) a thermo-chemical modeling framework
										based on the CO data, the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the mm-continuum emission;
										(2) an empirical temperature distribution based on optically thick CO lines; and (3) a direct fit to the
										C17O hyperfine lines. Results from these methods generally show excellent agreement. The CO gas
										column density profiles of the five disks show significant variations in the absolute value and the radial
										shape. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, all five disks have a global CO-to-H2 abundance of
										10-100 times lower than the ISM ratio. The CO gas distributions between 150-400 au match well with
										models of viscous disks, supporting the long-standing theory. CO gas gaps appear to be correlated
										with continuum gap locations, but some deep continuum gaps do not have corresponding CO gaps.
										The relative depths of CO and dust gaps are generally consistent with predictions of planet-disk
										interactions, but some CO gaps are 5-10 times shallower than predictions based on dust gaps. This
										paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> Constraining the distribution of gas and dust in the inner 20 au of protoplanetary disks is difficult. At
										the same time, this region is thought to be responsible for most planet formation, especially around the
										water ice line at 3-10 au. Under the assumption that the gas is in a Keplerian disk, we use the exquisite
										sensitivity of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA large program to
										construct radial surface brightness profiles with a ∼3 au effective resolution for the CO isotopologue
										J =2–1 lines using the line velocity profile. IM Lup reveals a central depression in 13CO and C18O
										that is ascribed to a pileup of ∼500 M⊕ of dust in the inner 20 au, leading to a gas-to-dust ratio of
										around <10. This pileup is consistent with efficient drift of grains (& 100 M⊕ Myr−1) and a local
										gas-to-dust ratio that suggests that the streaming instability could be active. The CO isotopologue
										emission in the GM Aur disk is consistent with a small (∼ 15 au), strongly depleted gas cavity within
										the ∼40 au dust cavity. The radial surface brightness profiles for both the AS 209 and HD 163296
										disks show a local minimum and maximum in the C18O emission at the location of a known dust ring
										(∼14 au) and gap (∼10 au), respectively. This indicates that the dust ring has a low gas-to-dust ratio
										(> 10) and that the dust gap is gas-rich enough to have optically thick C18O. This paper is part of
										the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> We explore the dynamical structure of the protoplanetary disks surrounding HD 163296 and MWC 480 as part of
										the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) large program. Using the J = 2–1 transitions of 12CO,
										13CO, and C18O imaged at spatial resolutions of ∼0 15 and with a channel spacing of 200 m s−1
										, we find
										perturbations from Keplerian rotation in the projected velocity fields of both disks (5% of the local Keplerian
										velocity), suggestive of large-scale (tens of astronomical units in size), coherent flows. By accounting for the
										azimuthal dependence on the projection of the velocity field, the velocity fields were decomposed into azimuthally
										averaged orthogonal components, vf, vr, and vz. Using the optically thick 12CO emission as a probe of the gas
										temperature, local variations of ≈3 K (≈5% relative changes) were observed and found to be associated with the
										kinematic substructures. The MWC 480 disk hosts a suite of tightly wound spiral arms. The spirals arms, in
										conjunction with the highly localized perturbations in the gas velocity structure (kinematic planetary signatures),
										indicate a giant planet, ∼1 MJup, at a radius of ≈245 au. In the disk of HD 163296, the kinematic substructures
										were consistent with previous studies of Pinte et al. and Teague et al. advocating for multiple ∼1 MJup planets
										embedded in the disk. These results demonstrate that molecular line observations that characterize the dynamical
										structure of disks can be used to search for the signatures of embedded planets. This paper is part of the MAPS

										<b>Abstract:</b> One of the most important questions in the field of planet formation is how mm-cm sized dust
										particles overcome the radial drift and fragmentation barriers to form kilometer-sized planetesimals.
										ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks, in particular transition disks or disks with clear signs
										of substructures, can provide new constraints on theories of grain growth and planetesimal formation
										and therefore represent one possibility to progress on this issue. We here present ALMA band 4 (2.1
										mm) observations of the transition disk system Sz 91 and combine them with previously obtained band
										6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) observations. Sz 91 with its well defined mm-ring, more extended gas
										disk, and evidence of smaller dust particles close to the star, is a clear case of dust filtering and the
										accumulation of mm sized particles in a gas pressure bump. We computed the spectral index (nearly
										constant at ∼3.34), optical depth (marginally optically thick), and maximum grain size (∼0.61 mm)
										in the dust ring from the multi-wavelength ALMA observations and compared the results with recently
										published simulations of grain growth in disk substructures. Our observational results are in very good
										agreement with the predictions of models for grain growth in dust rings that include fragmentation
										and planetesimal formation through the streaming instability.<br/>

										<b>Abstract:</b> PDS 70 is a unique system in which two protoplanets, PDS 70 b and c, have been discovered within the dust-depleted 
										cavity of their disk, at ~22 and 34 au, respectively, by direct imaging at infrared wavelengths. Subsequent detection of
										the planets in the Hα line indicates that they are still accreting material through circumplanetary disks. In this Letter,
										we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the dust continuum emission at 855 μm 
										at high angular resolution (~20 mas, 2.3 au) that aim to resolve the circumplanetary disks and constrain their dust masses.
										Our observations confirm the presence of a compact source of emission co-located with PDS 70 c, spatially separated from
										the circumstellar disk and less extended than ~1.2 au in radius, a value close to the expected truncation radius of the
										circumplanetary disk at a third of the Hill radius. The emission around PDS 70 c has a peak intensity of ~86 ± 16 μJy beam−1,
										which corresponds to a dust mass of ~0.031 M⊕ or ~0.007 M⊕, assuming that it is only constituted of 1 μm or 1 mm sized grains,
										respectively. We also detect extended, low surface brightness continuum emission within the cavity near PDS 70 b. We observe
										an optically thin inner disk within 18 au of the star with an emission that could result from small micron-sized grains
										transported from the outer disk through the orbits of b and c. In addition, we find that the outer disk resolves into a narrow
										and bright ring with a faint inner shoulder.<br/>
