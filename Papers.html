									<h3>The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): Complete Size Distributions for the 100 Brightest Disks Across Multiplicity and SED Classes</h3>
									<h4>Dasgupta et al. 2025</h4>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Dasgupta2025.png" alt="" /></span>
										Abstract: The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d ∼ 140-200 pc).
										We present the complete continuum size distribution for the 105 brightest protoplanetary disks (Mdust ≳ 2 M⊕) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA
										Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05′′ (7 au) to 0.15′′ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources,
										providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling 68% of the
										flux (R68%) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal
										with a median value of ∼14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation σlog=0.46 (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems (< 200 au separation)
										have smaller radii, with median value of ∼5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young
										embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age ≲ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age ∼ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be
										common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.

									<h3>Dust characterization of protoplanetary disks: a guide to multi-wavelength analyses and accurate dust mass measurements</h3>
									<h4>Viscardi et al. 2025</h4>									
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Viscardi2025.png" alt="" /></span>
										Abstract: Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key 
										ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. 
										We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis
										on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm → 7.46 mm range)
										to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies
										and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured
										in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer
										than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However,
										lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth
										of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations
										in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution
										of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total
										dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses
										from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically
										thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one
										order of magnitude.
